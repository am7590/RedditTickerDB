# RedditTickerDB

- Uses SQLite3 and my [WSB-Ticker-API](https://github.com/am7590/WSB-Ticker-API) to store ticker frequencies with tables corresponding to each day. 
- Retrieves stored data and displays a graph of the historical frequency trends for any ticker. 

### TODO
- [x] Analyze historical frequency trend data
- [ ] Deploy database to the cloud
- [ ] Add select features to [WSB-Ticker-API](https://github.com/am7590/WSB-Ticker-API)
